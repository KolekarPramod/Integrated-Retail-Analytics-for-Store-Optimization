## 🧭 Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on enhancing **retail store performance** through advanced **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **time-series forecasting** techniques. By integrating insights from sales data, external economic factors, and promotional strategies, we aim to build a holistic system that supports:

- **Anomaly Detection**
- **Demand Forecasting**
- **Customer Segmentation**
- **Store Optimization**
- **Personalized Marketing Strategies**

my ultimate goal is to translate data into **actionable strategies** for retail businesses to optimize inventory, improve marketing ROI, and elevate the customer experience.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. 📉 Detect anomalies in sales to identify irregular trends.
2. 📆 Use time-series analysis to model seasonal and holiday-driven patterns.
3. 🧹 Perform rigorous preprocessing and feature engineering to enrich data context.
4. 👥 Segment stores/departments based on behavioral patterns.
5. 🛒 Explore market basket opportunities using intra-departmental sales patterns.
6. 🔮 Build robust forecasting models to predict store- and department-level sales.
7. 🌐 Examine external economic indicators and their effects on demand.
8. 🧠 Develop personalization strategies tailored to store segments and markdown campaigns.
9. 🧪 Evaluate segmentation effectiveness through quantitative cluster metrics.
10. 🧭 Deliver real-world strategies for inventory and campaign optimization.

## 🧱 Project Components

### 1. 🚨 Anomaly Detection in Sales
- Identify outliers and irregular sales spikes/dips.
- Investigate root causes: markdowns, holidays, economic shifts.
- Clean and flag anomalies to improve downstream modeling accuracy.

### 2. ⏱️ Time-Based Anomaly Detection
- Visualize trends and seasonalities.
- Quantify holiday and event-based impacts.
- Use rolling means and STL decomposition for anomaly isolation.

### 3. 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handle missing MarkDown entries.
- Feature design: store type, region, department interactions, time lags.
- Normalize external metrics (e.g., CPI, unemployment) across time.

### 4. 👤 Customer & Store Segmentation
- Use unsupervised learning (K-Means, DBSCAN) to cluster stores or departments.
- Analyze markdown sensitivity and seasonal volatility across clusters.
- Visualize cluster behavior and optimize strategy per segment.

### 5. 🛒 Market Basket Analysis (Proxy-Based)
- Derive item associations using department-level weekly sales trends.
- Estimate co-purchase behavior through time-based co-movement.
- Propose bundle and cross-promotion opportunities.

### 6. 📈 Demand Forecasting
- Train time-series models: ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM.
- Forecast weekly sales per store and department.
- Incorporate economic and seasonal features to improve accuracy.

### 7. 🌍 External Factor Analysis
- Analyze CPI, fuel prices, regional employment data.
- Correlate with store performance over time.
- Factor these into forecasting and anomaly detection models.

### 8. 🎯 Personalization Strategies
- Design markdown schedules based on cluster responsiveness.
- Tailor inventory volumes based on predicted demand per store-segment.
- Recommend marketing strategies specific to cluster personas.

### 9. 📊 Segmentation Evaluation
- Validate cluster quality using:
  - Silhouette score
- Ensure segment interpretability and business applicability.

### 10. 🧭 Strategy Formulation
- Deliver actionable plans:
  - Inventory planning by region & segment
  - Markdown optimization calendars
  - Risk mitigation for economic shocks
- Discuss real-world deployment considerations: data availability, latency, cost of error
